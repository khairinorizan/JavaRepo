SIMPLE CHAT APPLICATION:

Steps for compiling and run:

STEP 1:
-- Read through and thorough this file

STEP 2 :
-- Import ChatApp to your development software such as Eclipse (or any software that could run Java program). 

STEP 3 :
-- You should be able to see two(2) Java file named ChatServer and ChatClient. After succesfully import ChatApp to Eclipse (or software that you are 
   using), run ChatServer. 
-- Running ChatServer will set up the server (or you can say turn on the server).
-- Now, you have set up the server, you should be able to connect client or chat member.

**Note: Run ChatServer first, otherwise, it won't work.

STEP 4 :
-- To connect a client or a chat member to the ChatServer, run ChatClient.
-- Once you run ChatClient, the client console will ask for your name. Enter your name, then press Enter.
-- After entering your name, console will be asking for the access code. Enter "cs319spring2020", then press Enter.

**Note: Console will keep asking for access code until the correct access code is given.

STEP 5 :
-- You are now in the chat room. You can start typing message.
-- However, you are alone in the chat room. So, no one will be hearing your message...

STEP 6 :
-- To not be a loner, you can add more people such as Kylie Jenner, Brad Pitt, or even Trump the President.
-- To do so, you can run ChatClient and repeat step 4.
-- Run ChatClient again if you want to add more people to the chat room.

----Leaving the chat room--------

STEP 1 : Terminate the console of the user that wants to leave the room

STEP 2 : He/She left the room. Say peace out..

** DO NOT TERMINATE THE SERVER OR YOU WONT BE ABLE TO SEND MESSAGE AGAIN
